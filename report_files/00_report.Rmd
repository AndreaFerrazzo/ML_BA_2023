Questions
- should we convert the binary columns to factor or can we leave them as integer for modelling?
- should we balance the data, in the rating_bin case and in the rating normal with 7 classes
- should we normalise the numerical data
- it's mentionned in the slides that the validation set should not be balanced, but how do we do that using train() with caret?
- should we really used balanced data for training? Because at least for KNN it always makes K=1 better, whereas K is was larger when we trained with unbalanced data
  Apparently for KNN, it's not required to balance data
